--ROUND 3,4 and 5 FOCUSES ON CHILDREN , LET'S EXPLORE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH IN GENERAL

select COUNT(DISTINCT(childid)) as no_children, chhealth

where survey_round is not null and chhealth is not null
group by chhealth


--Thus we can see that from the results higher number of 5187 children,  has chhealth of 3 and above which imples good health 
--the total number of children interviewed from round 3 to round 5 being 5511 when calculated manually from the result
--The total children having chhealth of 0 to 2 constitutes about 12.5% of the total children interviewed

--THUS WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT CHILDREN WITH BAD HEALTH CONSTITUTES ABOUT 6%,
--WHILE CHILDREN WITH GOOD HEALTH CONSTITUES THE REMAINING 94%

--LET'S ALSO EXPLORE THE CHILDREN'S CLADDER WHICH SERVE AS A MEASURE OF THEIR WELLBEING



select COUNT(DISTINCT(childid)) as no_children, cladder into cladder_table

--FROM THE RESULTS, WE SAW THAT THERE ARE MORE CHILDREN HAVING A GOOD WELL BEING THAN THE CHILDREN HAVING THE WORST POSSIBLE CHILDREN

--2 – We eat enough but not always what we would like 
--3 – We sometimes to not eat enough

--CALCULATING TRADITIONALLY, FROM THE RESULT WE COULD DEDUCE THAT:

--11% OF THE  HOUSEHOLDS INTERVIEWED ARE SATISFIED WITH THEIR FEEDING SITUATION
--51% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS INTERVIEWED EAT ENOUGH BUT NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY LIKE
--31% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS INTERVIEWED DO NOT EAT ENOUGH SOMETIMES

--39% of households HASN'T OBTAINED LOAN IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS


--WE NOW EXPLORE THE MOST IMPORTANT MEASURE IN THIS ANALYSIS: WEALTH INDEX WHICH IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS OF HOUSEHOLDS 
--WITHIN THE YOUNG LIVES SAMPLE

--we'll take wealth index >= 0.75 as rich
--weath index >= 0.5<0.75 as substantially okay
