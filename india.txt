--ROUND 3,4 and 5 FOCUSES ON CHILDREN , LET'S EXPLORE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH IN GENERAL

select COUNT(DISTINCT(childid)) as no_children, chhealth
from TASK1.ChildhoodPoverty.India_Updated 
where survey_round >= 3 and chhealth is not null
group by chhealth


--Thus we can see that from the results that a total  of 4859 children,  has chhealth of 3 and above which imples good health 
--the total number of children interviewed being 5153 when calculated manually from the result
--The total children having chhealth of 1 to 2 constitutes about 6% of the total children interviewed

--THUS WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT CHILDREN WITH BAD HEALTH CONSTITUTES ABOUT 6%,
--WHILE CHILDREN WITH GOOD HEALTH CONSTITUES THE REMAINING 94%

--LET'S ALSO EXPLORE THE CHILDREN'S CLADDER WHICH SERVE AS A MEASURE OF THEIR WELLBEING



select COUNT(DISTINCT(childid)) as no_children, cladder into india_cladder_table
from TASK1.ChildhoodPoverty.India_Updated 
where survey_round >= 2 and cladder <> 0
group by cladder


--I categorized less personal wellbeing from (cladder 1 to cladder 4) average as cladder 5, and better personal wellbeing from (cladder 6 to cladder9)
select sum(no_children) as no_lesserwellbeing_children from india_cladder_table
where cladder<=4

select sum(no_children) as no_betterwellbeing_children from india_cladder_table
where cladder > 4


--FROM THE RESULTS, WE SAW THAT THERE ARE MORE CHILDREN HAVING A GOOD WELL BEING OF 3388 THAN THE CHILDREN HAVING THE WORST POSSIBLE WELLBEING
--OF 4170

--LET'S EXPLORE THE LITERACY OF THE CHILDREN (LEVEL AT WHICH THEY CAN READ OR WRITE)
--to get the sum of children interviewed


with india_cte_1 as 
(
select COUNT(DISTINCT(childid)) as no_children, literate from TASK1.ChildhoodPoverty.India_Updated

select * from india_cte_1

--from the results, we could see that out of 3623 children interviewed on their literacy,
--1854 were illiterates, 1409 were literates 



--WE NOW WANT TO EXPLORE THE HOUSEHOLD'S FOOD SECURITY AND CREDIT (FOOD SITUATION IN THE HOUSEHOLD, AND IF THEY LIVE ON LOAN OR CREDIT RESPECTIVELY)
--the foodsec labels are below:

--1 – We always eat enough of what we want 
--2 – We eat enough but not always what we would like 
--3 – We sometimes to not eat enough 
--4 – We frequently do not eat enough.

--select sum(no_children) as total_children from foodsec_cte     --Result : 4222

select * from foodsec_cte

--CALCULATING TRADITIONALLY, FROM THE RESULT WE COULD DEDUCE THAT:

--35% OF THE  HOUSEHOLDS INTERVIEWED ARE SATISFIED WITH THEIR FEEDING SITUATION
--55% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS INTERVIEWED EAT ENOUGH BUT NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY LIKE
--8% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS INTERVIEWED DO NOT EAT ENOUGH SOMETIMES
--1% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS INTERVIEWED DO NOT EAT ENOUGH

--WE'D EXPLORE THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAS OBTAINED LOANS/CREDITS FOR THE PAST 12 MONTHS

with house_credit_cte as (

--select sum(no_households) as total_households_interviewed from house_credit_cte;   --result: 3756

select * from house_credit_cte

--WHEN CALCULATED MANUALLY, RESULTS SHOWED THAT 68% OF HOUSEHOLDS INTERVIEWED HAS OBTAINED LOAN IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS
--32% of households HASN'T OBTAINED LOAN IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS


--WE NOW EXPLORE THE MOST IMPORTANT MEASURE IN THIS ANALYSIS: WEALTH INDEX WHICH IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS OF HOUSEHOLDS 
--WITHIN THE YOUNG LIVES SAMPLE

--we'll take wealth index >= 0.75 as rich
--weath index >= 0.5<0.75 as substantially okay
--wealth index <0.5 as poor

--THUS THE WEALTH INDEX SHOWS THAT OUT OF 3019 children interviewed 
--2204 HAS A WEALTH INDEX BELOW O.5
--2516 HAS A WEALTH INDEX BETWEEN O.5 AND 0.75
--1029 HAS A WEALTH INDEX ABOVE 0.75
